* Parser

** Add core data structures and integrate with parser

- Use the context to hold the core objects and the process method to build it.

** Figure out how to handle parsing error

- It should only keep trying other possibilities as long as nothing has been
  matched.

- When something as already been matched but matching the full rule failed,
  it should raise an exception.

- This exception must capture the expected values, and the possition of the
  token that could not be matched.

- This probably requires using the context and an ~on_error~ method.

* Backlog

** Lexer

*** Add more token types

*** Keep accurate track of token location

** Code Quality

*** Mark private functions as such

*** Make use of type annotations

*** Add or improve docstrings, specially on lexer

*** Perform general code review and add comments
