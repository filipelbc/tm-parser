* Parser

** Add mechanism to allow passing a context (kind of a parser state) to the rules

- This must be available in the rule's ~process~ method

- Write small language for testing this.

** Figure out how to handle parsing error

- Need to tell the user where the parsing failed.
- Currently, the rules are "all or nothing", so we don't know how deep into
  the rule it got before failing.

+ This could be dealt with when using the context.
+ or by adding an "on error" method that must be overriden.

* Backlog

** Lexer

*** Add more token types

*** Keep accurate track of token location

** Code Quality

*** Mark private functions as such

*** Make use of type annotations

*** Add or improve docstrings, specially on lexer

*** Perform general code review and add comments
